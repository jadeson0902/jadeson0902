💗 **Profile** 💗 
Hello World

With over seven years of experience in JavaScript frameworks and libraries and four years as a project manager, I specialize in building scalable, user-friendly digital solutions. My expertise spans industries like online casinos, sports betting websites, and blockchain technology, including EVM, Solana, smart contracts, and Web3.

I excel in leveraging modern technologies like Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB while integrating third-party services such as Contentful, Algolia, Salesforce, and AWS. I prioritize creating solutions that are not only functional but also visually appealing, delivering an elevated user experience.

Passionate about innovation, I constantly explore new ways to push technical boundaries and craft impactful, cutting-edge digital experiences.
